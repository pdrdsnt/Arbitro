updating v3 factory return types 
integrating it with local db

search pool calls has horrible design
i need to subdivide v3 and v4 factory search calls

creating trait to flatten all possibilities

creating search contex and seatch engine
so i can organize local db integration
and these calls are already enough to justify an especiallized architeture
